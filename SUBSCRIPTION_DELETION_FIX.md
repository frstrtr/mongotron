# ‚úÖ Subscription Deletion Bug - FIXED

## Problem

When stopping the event monitor (Ctrl+C or timeout), the subscription deletion was happening **twice**, causing a 500 error on the second attempt:

```
üßπ Cleaning up subscription: sub_fa77ad23-289
‚úÖ Subscription deleted
üßπ Cleaning up subscription: sub_fa77ad23-289  ‚Üê DUPLICATE!
‚ö†Ô∏è  Failed to delete subscription: 500          ‚Üê ERROR!
```

## Root Cause

**Double-call scenario**:

1. ‚úÖ **Signal handler** (Ctrl+C) ‚Üí Calls `stop()` ‚Üí Deletes subscription (200 OK)
2. ‚úÖ **Finally block** (Python cleanup) ‚Üí Calls `stop()` again ‚Üí 500 error (already deleted)

The issue was that `sys.exit(0)` in the signal handler doesn't prevent Python's `finally` block from executing, leading to `stop()` being called twice.

## Solution

Added an **idempotency guard** to prevent `stop()` from executing twice:

```python
def stop(self):
    """Stop monitoring and cleanup"""
    # Guard against double-call
    if hasattr(self, '_stopped') and self._stopped:
        return  # Already stopped, do nothing
    self._stopped = True
    
    # ... rest of cleanup code
```

### How It Works

- **First call**: `_stopped` is not set ‚Üí Proceeds with cleanup
- **Second call**: `_stopped` is True ‚Üí Returns immediately (no-op)

## Results

### Before Fix ‚ùå

Server logs:
```
[23:21:57] 200 -    1.838099ms DELETE /api/v1/subscriptions/sub_fa77ad23-289
[23:21:57] 500 -      11.941¬µs DELETE /api/v1/subscriptions/sub_fa77ad23-289
```

### After Fix ‚úÖ

Server logs:
```
[23:35:21] 200 -    1.821782ms DELETE /api/v1/subscriptions/sub_b8a4d9e4-161
```

**Only ONE DELETE request!** No 500 error!

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Clean shutdown** - No confusing error messages  
‚úÖ **Idempotent** - Safe to call `stop()` multiple times  
‚úÖ **Efficient** - Reduces unnecessary API calls  
‚úÖ **Professional** - Better user experience  

## Testing

Tested with multiple scenarios:
- ‚úÖ Ctrl+C shutdown
- ‚úÖ Timeout termination (SIGTERM)
- ‚úÖ Normal exit

All scenarios now show **single deletion with 200 OK status**.

## Files Modified

- `event_monitor.py` (Lines 394-397): Added `_stopped` guard
