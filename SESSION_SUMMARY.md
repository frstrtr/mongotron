# MongoTron Event Monitor - Enhanced Logging Summary

## Session: October 5, 2025

### Issues Resolved

#### 1. ✅ Bug Fix: Block Processing Not Working
**Problem:** Monitor wasn't receiving events - subscriptions stuck at `currentBlock: -1`

**Root Causes:**
- Monitor start block handling only checked for `0`, not negative values (`-1`)
- Database `currentBlock` only updated when events detected, not during normal block processing

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Changed `if m.lastBlockNum == 0` to `if m.lastBlockNum <= 0` in `address_monitor.go`
- Added 10-second ticker to update `currentBlock` periodically in `manager.go`

**Files Modified:**
- `internal/blockchain/monitor/address_monitor.go` (Line 116)
- `internal/subscription/manager.go` (Lines 277-306)

**Results:**
- ✅ Monitors now start from current block
- ✅ `currentBlock` advances every ~3 seconds (Tron block time)
- ✅ Events being captured successfully
- ✅ System processing ~20 blocks per minute

**Documentation:**
- Created `BUGFIX_BLOCK_PROCESSING.md` with full technical details

#### 2. ✅ Enhancement: Detailed Event Logging
**Requirement:** Log every event received in full detail

**Features Added:**

**A. Enhanced Console Output**
1. **Event Header** - Basic info (ID, contract, TX hash, block, time)
2. **Full Event JSON** - Complete raw event data structure
3. **Complete Message Structure** - Entire WebSocket message
4. **Parsed Fields** - Human-readable sections (topics, hex data)
5. **Decoded Transfers** - Automatic USDT amount decoding

**B. File Logging**
1. **Timestamped Log Files** - Format: `events_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
2. **JSON Format** - Machine-readable, parseable logs
3. **Millisecond Timestamps** - Precise event timing
4. **Event Counter** - Numbered events for tracking
5. **Session Summary** - Total events logged on exit

**Files Modified:**
- `event_monitor.py` - Added detailed logging throughout

**New Features:**
```python
# File logger setup
self.setup_file_logger()

# Log every event to file
self.file_logger.info(f"EVENT #{count} - {json.dumps(event_data, indent=2)}")

# Show log location on exit
print(f"📝 Events saved to: {self.log_file}")
```

**Documentation:**
- Created `EVENT_LOGGING_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive usage examples

### Log File Details

**Current Log File:**
```
/home/user0/Github/mongotron/events_20251005_222831.log
```

**Format:**
```
2025-10-05 22:28:31,123 - EVENT #1 - {
  "type": "event",
  "data": {
    "id": "evt_...",
    "event_name": "Transfer",
    "contract_address": "TXYZopYRdj2D9XRtbG411XZZ3kM5VkAeBf",
    "transaction_hash": "...",
    "block_number": 61089116,
    "timestamp": 1759688754000,
    "topics": [...],
    "data": "..."
  }
}
```

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# View log file
cat events_20251005_222831.log

# Watch in real-time
tail -f events_20251005_222831.log

# Count events
grep "EVENT #" events_20251005_222831.log | wc -l

# Extract transaction hashes
grep -oP '"transaction_hash":\s*"\K[^"]+' events_20251005_222831.log

# Pretty print
cat events_20251005_222831.log | jq .
```

### Testing & Verification

#### Verified Working
1. ✅ **Subscription Creation** - Creating with startBlock: -1
2. ✅ **Block Processing** - Monitor advancing through blocks
3. ✅ **Event Capture** - Real events being detected
4. ✅ **Database Updates** - currentBlock updating every 10 seconds
5. ✅ **WebSocket Streaming** - Real-time event delivery
6. ✅ **Console Logging** - Detailed multi-level output
7. ✅ **File Logging** - Events persisted to timestamped log

#### Test Results
```
Before Fix:
- startBlock: -1, currentBlock: -1 (stuck)
- No events captured
- No visibility into processing

After Fix:
- startBlock: -1, currentBlock: 61089100+ (advancing)
- Events captured: 1+ and counting
- Full visibility with detailed logs
```

2. Implement log rotation for long-running monitors
3. Add statistics dashboard (events/minute, contract activity)
4. Create event replay functionality from log files
5. Add support for multiple contract types (NFTs, etc.)
6. Implement webhook notifications for specific events
