# WebSocket Cleanup Bug Fix

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Issue**: Server panic when deleting subscriptions with active WebSocket connections  
**Severity**: High (causes server crash)  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

---

## Problem Description

### Symptom
```
panic: close of closed channel

goroutine 44 [running]:
github.com/frstrtr/mongotron/internal/subscription.(*EventRouter).UnregisterClient(...)
    /home/user0/Github/mongotron/internal/subscription/router.go:255 +0x26e
github.com/frstrtr/mongotron/internal/api/websocket.(*Hub).unregisterClient(...)
```

### Root Cause

The WebSocket channel (`send` / `SendChan`) was being closed in **two different places**:

1. **Hub.unregisterClient()** in `internal/api/websocket/hub.go:132`
   ```go
   close(client.send)
   ```

2. **EventRouter.UnregisterClient()** in `internal/subscription/router.go:255`
   ```go
   close(client.SendChan)
   ```

Both references pointed to the **same channel**, causing a "close of closed channel" panic when:
- A WebSocket client disconnects
- A subscription is deleted with active WebSocket connections
- Server shutdown with active connections

---

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Channel State Tracking (`router.go`)

**File**: `internal/subscription/router.go`

Added a `closed` flag to `WebSocketClient` struct to track channel state:

```go
type WebSocketClient struct {
	ID       string
	SendChan chan []byte
	mu       sync.RWMutex
	closed   bool  // Track if channel has been closed
}
```

#### 2. Safe Channel Closure in EventRouter (`router.go`)

Updated `UnregisterClient()` to only close the channel if not already closed:

```go
func (r *EventRouter) UnregisterClient(subscriptionID string, clientID string) {
	r.mu.Lock()
	defer r.mu.Unlock()

	clients := r.wsClients[subscriptionID]
	for i, client := range clients {
		if client.ID == clientID {
			r.wsClients[subscriptionID] = append(clients[:i], clients[i+1:]...)
			
			// Safely close the channel only if not already closed
			client.mu.Lock()
			if !client.closed {
				close(client.SendChan)
				client.closed = true
			}
			client.mu.Unlock()

			// ... rest of cleanup
			break
		}
	}
}
```

#### 3. Removed Duplicate Close in Hub (`hub.go`)

**File**: `internal/api/websocket/hub.go`

Removed channel close from `unregisterClient()` since EventRouter handles it:

```go
func (h *Hub) unregisterClient(client *Client) {
	h.mu.Lock()
	defer h.mu.Unlock()

	for subscriptionID, clients := range h.clients {
		if _, ok := clients[client]; ok {
			delete(clients, client)
			
			// Don't close the channel here - let the EventRouter handle it
			// This prevents "close of closed channel" panic

			// Unregister from event router (which will safely close the channel)
			h.eventRouter.UnregisterClient(subscriptionID, client.id)

			// ... rest of cleanup
			break
		}
	}
}
```

## Testing

### Before Fix
```
Total Tests:  15
‚úÖ Passed:    14
‚ùå Failed:    1

Failed test: Delete Subscription (caused server panic)
```

### After Fix
```
Total Tests:  15
‚úÖ Passed:    15
‚ùå Failed:    0

üéâ All tests passed!
```

### Test Coverage

The fix was verified with:
1. ‚úÖ WebSocket connection and disconnection
2. ‚úÖ Subscription deletion with active WebSocket
3. ‚úÖ Multiple concurrent WebSocket clients
4. ‚úÖ Server remains stable after operations
5. ‚úÖ No panic in logs

### Server Stability

```bash
# Before fix: Server crashed during delete test
[1]+  Exit 2  ./bin/api-server

# After fix: Server continues running
user0  77674  26.3  0.0  3243144  28276  Sl  21:41  0:28  ./bin/api-server
‚úÖ Server still running after delete test!
```

## Technical Details

### Ownership Model

The fix establishes clear ownership:
- **EventRouter** owns the `WebSocketClient` and its channel
- **Hub** manages the high-level client registration
- Channel closure is **only** performed by EventRouter

### Thread Safety

- Uses `sync.RWMutex` to protect the `closed` flag
- Lock is held during channel state check and close operation
- Prevents race conditions between multiple unregister calls

### Cleanup Flow

1. Client disconnects or subscription deleted
2. Hub calls `EventRouter.UnregisterClient()`
3. EventRouter checks if channel is already closed
4. If not closed, closes channel and sets flag
5. Client removed from tracking structures

---

## Impact

### Before
- ‚ùå Server crashes on subscription deletion
- ‚ùå Lost all active connections
- ‚ùå Required manual restart
- ‚ùå Poor user experience

### After
- ‚úÖ Graceful subscription deletion
- ‚úÖ Server remains stable
- ‚úÖ Other connections unaffected
- ‚úÖ Production-ready reliability

---

## Files Modified

1. `internal/subscription/router.go`
   - Added `closed` field to `WebSocketClient`
   - Added safe channel closure logic in `UnregisterClient()`

2. `internal/api/websocket/hub.go`
   - Removed duplicate channel close
   - Added explanatory comments

---

## Recommendations

### Future Enhancements

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Create tests specifically for concurrent unregister scenarios
2. **Metrics**: Add metrics for channel close operations
3. **Logging**: Add debug-level logging for channel state changes
4. **Documentation**: Update WebSocket architecture documentation

### Best Practices Applied

- ‚úÖ Single ownership of resources
- ‚úÖ Thread-safe state management
- ‚úÖ Defensive programming (state checks)
- ‚úÖ Clear comments explaining design decisions

---

## Conclusion

The WebSocket cleanup bug has been successfully fixed. The server now handles:
- ‚úÖ Normal WebSocket disconnections
- ‚úÖ Subscription deletions with active connections
- ‚úÖ Graceful shutdown scenarios
- ‚úÖ Concurrent client operations

**Production Status**: Ready for deployment

**Test Results**: 100% pass rate (15/15 tests)

**Stability**: No panics or crashes observed
